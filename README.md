############ Final Project Deliverable: Mars expedition - Setting up Base Perimeter using OOP ############



Overview
Well done, Commander!

Four weeks have passed since we took off, and we have finally landed. Thanks to the prior knowledge provided by your crew members, the team has been able to avert a possible alien attack. Our shuttle shows no evident sign of damage, and all systems are back online.

Thanks to the creativity of design engineers at UATSA, we have the elements necessary to set up a base with light but strong materials. Your ship contains the equipment to project 3D models of the base, along with detailed instructions and blueprints.



Give your new Mars base a great name.  Your base is designed following object-oriented construction principles. This base should consist of at least five pods: Dormitories, Cafeteria, Laboratory, Command Center, and storage.  You are encouraged to add more Pods to your base.

Each pod has attributes, aka properties, that hold data (usually nouns). Some suggestions are Name, Entry Code, Color, Construction Duration, Temperature, and Construction Status. You may create different properties that better fit your base.

Each pod performs functions aka methods (usually verbs) such as setting temperature, turning on light, turning off light, and other methods you can think of that would be useful to your base operations.

We will use inheritance to make this easier for us. Create a (parent) pod class and add methods and properties to it. Then, create child pod classes and add methods and properties to them.

Here are some ideas below. You don't have to follow any of these, you may make your base how you like it. But you must use OOP and inheritance.

Type of Pod (Child Classes)	Attributes (Properties)	functions (Methods)
Dormitory	Number of Beds	Open Water
Number of Lavatories	Shut Water Off
Number of Showers	
Cafeteria	Stations	Open Water
Shut Water Off
Status (open or closed)	Close
Number of Tables	Prepare Meals
Cleanliness	Cleanup
Laboratory	Status (accessible or locked)	Set Security
Security Levels (1, 2, or 3)	Open
Lock
Unlock
Command Center	Comm Status	Lock Down Unit
Storage	Capacity	Increase Temperature
Climate Control	Decrease Temperature
Your mission is to write a program following these guidelines:
This should be a brand-new app! While using your existing skills, you will create a new app!
The top Parent Class "Pod" cannot be instantiated (which means objects cannot be created from it). Instead, you should create all your objects using the main method from the child classes, like the CommandCenter class, Storage class, and other child classes!
All the sub-units think subclasses are based on the "Pod" parent class. Think super class!
Over comment your code.
Make a great UX!
You may reuse your other class files or create new ones to populate your base with people and other objects.
In your main method, create objects and make a program that demonstrates a day's operation at the Mar's Base.
Create a YouTube video link of your program in action while you demo it, and explain how it meets the requirements above as a user.
Pro Tips for your Project:
Have fun with the project and be creative
Start with a parent class called Pod.
Then, make the child classes from the table above.
Put all the shared methods and properties in the parent pod.
All the methods and properties that cannot be shared should be included in their own child classes.
Don't forget the constructors to set the values of the properties.
Pro Tips for Your Project Video:

Get Excited!

In this Assignment, you get to show off your Final Project with a user video. You will demonstrate that you can make a serious application in Java from start to finish. This is a complete project which is useful to the end user.  You will convey to your audience why it is useful and have fun.  At the end of your video, anyone who has watched it should want to use your application.

No need to edit your video!

Don’t worry about dressing up for this presentation. The goal is to develop skills in talking comfortably and relaxing on a video while conveying the needed information. Smiling and having fun in this video are okay and encouraged. I will not mark off for mistakes in speech, appearance, or area background. There is no need to restart the video if you make a mistake. Say that it was a mistake, correct it, and go forward.

Where and for how long?

This video should be uploaded to YouTube. Just turn in a link in a text file or in the comments. 
Mark your video as unlisted or public but not private. 
Time should be at least 1 minute or more!
How do I make a video?

You may use screen recording software such as MS Teams or one of your choices, or you can just use your phone and point it at the app as you use it while talking.

Do I have to talk during the video and show myself?

You do not have to show yourself on video, but you can. You must talk in the video and explain your app to a user.

 

Submission Deliverables
Submit a YouTube video link of your program in action while you demo and explain how it meets the requirements above as a user.
Submit all your .java source code files. Do not zip these files.
